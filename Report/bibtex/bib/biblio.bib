abstract = {Ribonucleic acid (RNA) represents the central player in the central dogma of molecular biology which states DNA is transcribed to RNA and RNA is translated into protein. However, recent studies have shown that RNA has a large and ever expanding role in cells. RNA can provide a physical scaffold for protein complexes, catalyze chemical reactions itself, regulate the process of DNA replication, regulate RNA transcription, and regulate protein translation. To achieve all of its multifaceted functions, RNA is divided in many classes based on size, structure, chemical modification, and sequence. The entire set of RNAs present in a cell constitute the RNA transcriptome. Because the RNA transcriptome is very large, constituting >20,000 genes from hundreds of thousands of transcripts in human cells, analysis requires specific tools, methods, and technological platforms to gather, process, calculate, evaluate and inform upon these unique and important molecules. This article seeks to introduce the reader to important fundamental terms and concepts needed to understand RNA informatics.}

abstract = {We study the problem of finding highly connected subgraphs of undirected and directed graphs. For undirected graphs, the notion of density of a subgraph we use is the average degree of the subgraph. For directed graphs, a corresponding notion of density was introduced recently by Kannan and Vinay. This is designed to quantify highly connectedness of substructures in a sparse directed graph such as the web graph. We study the optimization problems of finding subgraphs maximizing these notions of density for undirected and directed graphs. This paper gives simple greedy approximation algorithms for these optimization problems. We also answer an open question about the complexity of the optimization problem for directed graphs.},
